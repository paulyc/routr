Follow this guide to secure the signaling between your endpoints and **Routr**. Keep in mind that **Routr** will only secure the signaling and that the endpoints are ultimately responsible for securing the media.

> For this guide, we will use a fictitious domain name to demonstrate the process of securing the signaling path

## Creating a Java Keystore(.JKS) Certificate

**Routr** needs a keystore (.jks) in order to properly handling the certificates. The following steps will create a valid keystore file using a self-signed method or using the free [Let's Encrypt service](https://letsencrypt.org/).

### Creating a self-signed Certificate

Perhaps the easiest way to create a valid certificate for **Routr** is using a self-signed certificate. To generate the certificate change into `etc/certs` in your **Routr** installation and run the following script:

```bash
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA \
 -noprompt \
 -alias routr \
 -keystore domain-certs.jks \
 -storepass changeit \
 -keypass changeit \
 -validity 365 \
 -keysize 2048 \
 -dname "CN=sip.ocean.com, OU=OSS, O=Your Company Inc, L=Sanford, ST=NC, C=US" \
 -ext SAN=dns:sip.ocean.com,dns:localhost,ip:127.0.0.1
```

Remember to adjust the values to match your project's information.

> `WSS` will not work with a self-signed certificate. However, you can add a security exception by using `https` instead of `wss` in your browser's search bar and then accepting the security certificate.

### Creating a Certificate using Letâ€™s Encrypt

The recommended way to create a valid certificate for **Routr** is using the free service [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org). Please go to https://letsencrypt.org/ for details on how to install the required tooling. To generate the certificate, use the following steps:

**1. Create keys**

```bash
certbot certonly --standalone -d sip.ocean.com --email admin@sip.ocean.com
```

Change to the directory where the certificates were created(normally at /etc/letsencrypt/live/sip.ocean.com).

**2. Create a PKCS12 file containing full chain and private key**

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -in fullchain.pem -inkey privkey.pem -out pkcs.p12 -name domains-cert.jks
```

Please make note of the password since you will need it in the following step and also for your settings in **Routr**.

**3. Convert PKCS12 to Keystore**

```bash
keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore keystore.pkcs12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore domains-cert.jks
```

## Installing the Certificate in Routr

To enable secure signaling in **Routr**, copy your certificate in `etc/certs` and edit the file `config/config.yml` to look like this:

```yml
apiVersion: v1beta1
metadata:
  userAgent: Routr v1.0
spec:
  securityContext:
    keyStore: etc/certs/domains-cert.jks
    trustStore: etc/certs/domains-cert.jks
    keyStorePassword: 'changeit'
    trustStorePassword: 'changeit'
    keyStoreType: 'jks'
    debugging: true                  # Enabled debug only for testing
  transport:
    - protocol: tls
      port: 5061
...
```

With the property `spec.securityContext.debugging` set to `true` you can get some valuable information about the status of the configuration. You can also test your configuration using the following command:

```
openssl s_client -host 192.168.1.2 -port 5061    # Remember to use Routr's IP
```

## Setting up the Sip Phones

> For the purpose of this guide, we are using `Blink Pro`.

Go to the account that you want to secure, select `Advanced -> Sip Signaling` and change the parameter `Primary Proxy` to `${proxyHost}:${proxyPort};transport=tls`. See the example in the following image:

If everything went well you should see a green padlock like the one in the image below:
