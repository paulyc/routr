### What is Routr?

Routr is an open-source SIP Server and tooling to deploy VoIP networks. See the [overview](/docs/introduction/overview).

### What dependencies does Routr have?

The main Routr server runs standalone and has no external dependencies.

### How does Routr compare with other SIP servers

See the [comparison page](/docs/introduction/comparison).

### What language is Routr written in?

Most Routr components are written in Javascript(with Oracle Nashorn). Some are also written in Java.

### What will happen once Nashorn is deprecated?

The announcement Nashorn will soon be [deprecated](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/335) is definitely a concern. The current course of action is to wait and see if GraalJS is a viable replacement for Nashorn or completely re-write the project in Java. In either case, we believe we have time to make the decision later this year.

### What license is Routr released under?

Routr is released under the [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) license.
